### Notes and Isntructions

The components in this project were copied from phila-ui. (In the future this will be updated in the future with an NPM library.)

Check if vue CLI is installed (if not then install it from https://cli.vuejs.org/)

Check and install the latest version from the command prompt: npm install @vue/cli -g

City standards for a new vue.js application: https://phila.city/display/appdev/Code+Style+Guidelines

If you do not already have it installed, follow the link from the city standards site  for EditorConfg for VS Code and click install. 

Run the following from your command prompt: 

npm install bulma
npm install --save-dev node-sass sass-loader

[note: sass loader version has a bug/incompatibility with vue compiler, use version lower than 8.0.0 for now]


For any new components, look to https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue and check to see if it is compatible with bulma (or how difficult it would be to change to be compatible)
