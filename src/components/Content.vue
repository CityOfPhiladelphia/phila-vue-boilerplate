            A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away. Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on. ... the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other. Insults are effective only where emotion is present. It's hard to believe that something which is neither seen nor felt can do so much harm.

            With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censored, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably. Compassion: that's the one things no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. <a href="#">Our species</a> can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. You remove those obstacles. Without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die. To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness -- from within -- and from without. I object to intellect without discipline; I object to power without constructive purpose. To Boldly Go Where No Man Has Gone Before... Khaaannnn!

Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. You remove those obstacles. Without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die. It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. I object to intellect without discipline; I object to power without constructive purpose. Beam Me Up, Scotty! So much for the little training cruise. I’ve done far worse than kill you. …I’ve hurt you; and I intend to go on… hurting you. I will leave you as you left me; as you left her. Marooned for all eternity at the center of a dead planet. …Buried alive; buried alive….

            Insufficient facts always invite danger. You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, and irrational fear of the unknown. There is no such thing as the unknown. Only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood.

            They used to say that if Man was meant to fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see. We prefer to help ourselves. We make mistakes, but we're human -- and maybe that's the word that best explains us. A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior -- mentally or otherwise. …Warp speed. You’ve never really faced death, have you?” “...No; not like this. I haven’t faced death. I’ve cheated death. I’ve tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity; I know nothing.

            Live now; make now always the most precious time. Now will never come again. ... the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other. Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis. Did Einstein, Kazanga or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule? You can't simply say, 'Today I will be brilliant.' Change is the essential process of all existence.
